# Windows Media Center Status Light
Get visual status on Windows Media Center using PowerShell and a ThingM blink(1) USB RGB LED. 

I use Windows Media Center as a headless server (no monitor, mouse, keybaord) and I use extenders throughout the house to watch and record TV on. I wanted to be able to see if WMC was doing something important at a quick glance. Such as an extender watching TV, or if it was recording something. 

By using a ThingM blink(1) USB RGB LED, I'm able to accomplish this.

## Warranty

There is no warranty that this will work. In my testing it seems very stable. 

I'm open to pull requests to make this better!
